### Hi there 👋
I’m Timon Schelling as far as I can tell from planet Earth 🌍 dimension C-137. My heart 🩺 started beating more than 21 earth years ago. You could call me really obsessed with science, math and technology. When I’m once again out of portal gun charge I consider problem solving a skill that is worth practicing. Once I found my problem or project I’m really into it like a Mr. Me6 but hopefully without the dying after success. I truly believe in opensource. No intergalactic government should be allowed to keep knowledge as their property. This profile is all about me, my projects and hopefully one day my research. 🛸🚀🛰🌈🌈🌈🌈
